# About

In this challenge, you are responsible for creating a Restful API that provides ways to transfer money from one person to another. Each user in the system has a balance that is updated with each transfer.

# How to run

Using: `make run-build` or `make run`

# Requirements

- [ ] Create an endpoint that receives two user ids and a monetary value representing the transfer between them.
- [ ] Create an endpoint that receives a user id and returns their balance.
- [ ] Validate that the source user has sufficient balance before the transfer.
- [ ] It is necessary to consider the possibility of transfer concurrency where two people transfer money at the same time to a third party.
- [ ] If a transfer fails, the balance of the source user must be restored.
